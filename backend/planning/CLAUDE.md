# Planning Service — Claude Context (CARD-005)

## Key architecture decisions

- **logging/ stub removed**: The stub `logging/__init__.py` shadowed Python stdlib `logging` and broke all test imports. Renamed log-from-plan functionality to `logplan/` package. Do not recreate `logging/` as a package in this service.
- **Inline nutrition denormalization**: `meal_plan_assignments` stores `kcal_per_unit`, `protein_g_per_unit`, `fat_g_per_unit`, `carbs_g_per_unit` so that PDF export and plan summary work without a runtime call to the Catalog service. The client populates these at assignment-creation time.
- **product_name denormalization**: Also stored inline in `meal_plan_assignments` so PDF renders product names without a Catalog call (NFR-004 < 3 s).
- **Week-flagged products (ADR-0002)**: Only fetched from Catalog for the current ISO week. Falls back to `[]` gracefully if Catalog is unavailable. Uses `mealplan.router.get_this_week_products` (imported at router module level) — patch there in tests, not at `weekflag_reader.service`.
- **NutritionTarget UPSERT**: `PUT /plan/target` is idempotent — exactly one target per user (INV-014). Implemented as get-then-update-or-create.
- **Assignment limit (INV-010)**: Enforced in service layer (`count >= 10_000 → AssignmentLimitError → 409`). Uses `func.count` in DB, not Python-side counting.
- **Dual-client test pattern**: When two client fixtures (`client`, `client_user2`) are in the same test, `app.dependency_overrides` is shared and the last-set fixture wins. Seed user data via `db` fixture directly rather than using both client fixtures for writes.
- **PDF**: Uses `reportlab` pure-Python library. Generates in-memory (`io.BytesIO`), well under the 3 s NFR-004 limit.
- **Log-from-plan (ADR-0001)**: Writes to `tracking_entries` table in the Planning DB. Returns 0 entries (not an error) for empty days / invalid assignment IDs.

## How to run tests

```bash
cd backend/planning
python3 -m pytest tests/ -q
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./planning.db` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `IDENTITY_SERVICE_URL` | `http://identity:8000` | Identity service for token validation |
| `CATALOG_SERVICE_URL` | `http://catalog:8000` | Catalog service for week flags + product search |

## Non-obvious constraints

- `MealSlot` enum values must be lowercase: `breakfast`, `lunch`, `dinner`, `snacks`.
- Week format is strict ISO `YYYY-WW` (e.g. `2026-27`). The string `"current"` or an omitted `week` param defaults to today's ISO week via `date.today().isocalendar()`.
- The `logging/` directory must NOT exist as a Python package — it shadows `stdlib logging` and breaks pytest + FastAPI logging.
- Inline nutrition fields (`kcal_per_unit` etc.) are nullable. Summary totals use `COALESCE(..., 0.0)` in SQL so NULL values contribute 0 rather than NULL-propagating the sum.
